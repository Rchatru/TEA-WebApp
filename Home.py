WebApp built with Python and Streamlit designed to provide a more user-friendly interaction with the results of the PhD research
aimed at the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder using eye-tracker eye dynamics data of the participants.

The application is divided into different sub-pages, each with a distinct purpose:

- First of all, there is the "Home" screen, which contains a basic introduction and from which the rest of the screens can be accessed.
- Secondly, there is a [page](https://share.streamlit.io/rchatru/tea-webapp/Home.py/Model) where it is possible to provide further training data to carry out a re-training of the algorithm (under construction).
- Finally, in the [third](https://share.streamlit.io/rchatru/tea-webapp/Home.py/Predict) section, it is possible to enter the data of a specific individual in order to carry out a diagnosis by the model.
